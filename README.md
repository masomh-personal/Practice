# Interview Prep - Mastering Software Engineering & Problem-Solving

Welcome to my **Practice** repository! This is where I systematically **prepare for technical interviews**, refine my **data structures & algorithms** skills, and strengthen my **software engineering expertise**.

This repository serves as my **structured roadmap** to landing a great software engineering role, showcasing my **problem-solving abilities**, **coding efficiency**, and **clean coding practices**.

---

## **Why This Repo Exists**
As a software engineer passionate about **writing efficient, scalable, and clean code**, I am committed to **consistent practice** and **continuous improvement**. This repository is my **dedicated space** to:
- Sharpen my **data structures & algorithms** knowledge.
- Solve **Leetcode-style** coding problems using **JavaScript (primary language)**.
- Practice **real-world interview questions** covering **system design, algorithms, and JavaScript internals**.
- Maintain a **high-quality coding standard** by emphasizing **readability, efficiency, and test coverage**.
- Implement **multiple approaches (where applicable)** and evaluate **time & space complexity**.

---

## **How This Repo Is Organized**
This repository follows a **structured approach** to interview prep.

### **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Contains Leetcode, Exercism, and other **DSA problems** organized by:
- **Problem name & number** (e.g., `21_MergeTwoSortedLists.js`).
- **Efficient solutions** with **detailed explanations & complexity analysis**.
- **Well-structured test files** (`*.test.js`) to validate correctness.

---

## **My Thought Process & Approach**
### **ðŸ”¹ Efficient, Readable Code**
- I prioritize **writing clean and maintainable code**, not just brute-force solutions.
- Each solution is graded based on **efficiency (Big-O complexity)** and **readability**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Testing-Driven Development (TDD)**
- Every algorithm solution includes a **comprehensive test file**.
- I use the **Vitest framework** to ensure correctness & catch edge cases.

### **ðŸ”¹ Multiple Approaches & Optimizations**
- I solve problems using **brute force â†’ optimized â†’ best approach**.
- Each approach includes a **clear explanation of why it's chosen**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Real-World Applications**
- I donâ€™t just solve problemsâ€”I think about **how algorithms apply in real-world scenarios**.
- I analyze **where similar patterns appear in system design & large-scale applications**.
